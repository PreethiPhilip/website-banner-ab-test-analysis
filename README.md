## 📊 Website Banner A/B Test Analysis
### 🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes the results of an A/B test conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a new website banner design. The goal was to determine whether the new banner leads to higher user engagement and conversion compared to the original version.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* SQL (for data extraction)

* Python (Pandas, SciPy)

* Tableau (for visualization)

* Jupyter Notebook

### 🎯 Objectives
* Design a statistically sound A/B test to evaluate two website banner versions.

* Analyze user-level engagement data using SQL.

* Visualize conversion performance in Tableau.

* Provide data-driven recommendations for marketing and design teams.

### 🧮 Methodology
* Aggregated user interaction data using SQL (CTEs, Joins, Window Functions).

* Performed statistical analysis (t-test) using Excel to compare conversion rates.

* Built Tableau dashboards to communicate results effectively.

### 📈 Key Insights
* User conversion rates increased significantly after seeing the banner.

* Statistical significance was confirmed (p-value < 0.05).

* Users in Segment A (e.g., mobile vs. desktop) responded better to the new design.

### 📁 Dataset
* Internal simulated dataset of user impressions, clicks, and conversions.

* Aggregated metrics by user_id, date, device type, and variant group.


### 📚 What I Learned
* Applying rigorous statistical testing to business experiments.

* Translating raw SQL data into clear visual insights.

* Communicating technical findings to non-technical stakeholders.
